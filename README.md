This repo contains a curated collecting of software for Hydrography


## **Free and Open Software for Ocean Mapping (FOSSOM)** 
FOSSOM may be used to optimize survey design, troubleshoot and resolve multibeam system performance issues, derive products, and enhance data visualization and dissemination. 


### Survey planning and design
- [CruiseTools](https://github.com/simondreutter/cruisetools). A QGIS plugin aimed to simplify and automate common tasks in multibeam surveys

- [MBES Planning Tool](https://github.com/capt-clay10/MBES-Planning-Tool) is simplified GUI based tool to calculate line spacing, coverage and time taken.

- [BathyGlobe GapFiller](https://ccom.unh.edu/vislab/tools/gapfiller/) is a Windows tool designed to support planning for transit and area mapping, providing the latest versions of GEBCO bathymetry as context for planning. Gapfiller complements the online [Bathyglobe](https://bathyglobe.ccom.unh.edu/), an interactive globe to highlight the ocean mapping activities within the Seabed 2030 project.
- [AMUST](https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/formulieren/aanvraagformulier-software-hydrografische-normen), A-priori Multibeam Uncertainty Simulation Tool, is a Windows desktop software to compute the vertical and horizontal uncertainties in different operational circumstances. It is based on the error analysis of Hare et al (*Accuracy estimation of Canadian swath  and sweep sounding system, Canadian Hydrographic Service, 1995*)
- [SmartMap](https://www.hydroffice.org/smartmap/main), Sea Mapper's Acoustic Ray Tracing Monitor and Planning, is an online app within the [Hydroffice](https://www.hydroffice.org/) framework. SmartMap provides tools to evaluate the impact of oceanographic temporal and spatial variability on hydrographic surveys.  
### Data acquisition
- [Sound Speed Manager](https://www.hydroffice.org/soundspeed/) is a Python-based tool within the [Hydroffice](https://www.hydroffice.org/) framework that presents an intuitive, but feature-rich interface to guide the user through the processing steps required to deliver an enhanced sound speed profile to the acquisition system.
